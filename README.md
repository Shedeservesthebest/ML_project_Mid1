# ML_project_Mid1
# AAPL Stock Price Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices** using machine learning models. The dataset consists of historical stock market data, and various regression techniques are applied to forecast future prices. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts **next-day closing prices** based on past trends.

## üèó Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Lasso & Ridge Regression
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
